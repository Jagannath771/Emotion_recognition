# Facial Emotion Recognition Project

Welcome to the Facial Emotion Recognition Project repository! This project aims to accurately classify facial expressions into seven distinct emotional classes using machine learning techniques. The repository contains the necessary code and resources to replicate the project's results and run the models for real-time predictions.

## Project Overview

This project involves the following key components:

1. **Dataset**: The dataset comprises a diverse collection of facial images, each labeled with one of the seven emotional categories: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise, and neutral.

2. **Models**:
   - **Model 1 (CNN)**: A Convolutional Neural Network designed for facial emotion recognition.
   - **Model 2 (Deep CNN)**: An extended CNN architecture with increased depth to capture intricate features.
   - **Model 3 (Transfer Learning)**: Utilizing a pre-trained CNN architecture fine-tuned for the emotion recognition task.

3. **Real-Time Predictions**: The best-performing model is deployed for real-time predictions, allowing for instant facial emotion recognition from live video streams.

## Steps to Run the Model

To replicate the results and run the models on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/facial-emotion-recognition.git
cd facial-emotion-recognition
